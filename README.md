# Scoreboard :sparkles:
### A board for publicly displaying the score in a game

This project is based on [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/)'s course for create applications with React. But I love Vue, for this reason I builded the same challenge using Vue and Vuex.

If you have a recommendation for this application. Submit an a [issue](https://github.com/coderdiaz/scoreboard/issues/new).
